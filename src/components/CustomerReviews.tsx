        "GoodBytes made my FlavorForge a valid purchase.  It's not perfect, but it's a lot better than working with this hunk of plastic all on my own.  I wish their fillaments were of better quality.  Buy those directly from FF if you can."},

        "Verily, I find myself most confounded by this GoodBytes website. Methought I was purchasing simple victuals, but alas, 'tis revealed one requires a contrivance known as a FlavorForge to make any sense of it. I spent a fair sum customizing these meals, only to discover I can do naught with them sans this infernal device. 'Tis like trying to play a phonograph record on a modern contraption. Such newfangled nonsense is beyond my ken. Would that they made it plainer what one was entangling oneself with. Not for this old soul, I say."},
